# divisor-game
Its a small divisor game that I created as part of an assignment for my AI class in Fall 2018.
First, it asks for First and Second player's name, then it asks for a positive integer n.
Then the program will provide all the divisors of the positive integer n as a List.
First player would have to choose any number from the list and then the program will give a List removing all the divisors of the number that player 1 chose. Then player 2 would have to choose from that remaining numbers.
Whoever is left with no choice but the original positive integer n that we chose in the beginning of the game, loses!
Or if anyone chooses the integer n, loses!
